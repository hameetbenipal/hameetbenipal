Software Developer | Cloud & AWS Specialist | Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional

I am a Software Developer with a strong background in cloud computing, API development, and automation, with hands-on experience in AWS technologies including Lambda, CloudWatch, and SQS. I’ve worked extensively on ensuring the reliability and performance of production environments, utilizing tools like Kibana for monitoring and optimization.

Recently, I expanded my skill set by earning the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate, gaining expertise in network security, incident response, and SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic Stack. I’m now combining my software development background with my growing passion for cybersecurity to build secure and efficient systems.

Looking forward to applying my expertise in both development and security to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation.

## Objective

A highly motivated software developer with hands-on experience in designing and implementing scalable applications, recently expanding into cybersecurity to strengthen expertise in secure software development and threat mitigation. Passionate about leveraging a strong foundation in programming, automation, and security best practices to contribute to innovative projects in both fields. Seeking a role where I can apply my combined knowledge of software engineering and cybersecurity to build robust, secure, and efficient solutions while continuously learning and growing in a dynamic environment.
